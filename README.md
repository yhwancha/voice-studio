# Whisper Transcription App

A full-stack application that provides real-time audio transcription using OpenAI's Whisper model. The application consists of a FastAPI backend for audio processing and a Next.js frontend for a modern, responsive user interface.

## Features

- Real-time audio transcription using OpenAI's Whisper model
- Modern, responsive UI built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS
- RESTful API backend using FastAPI
- Audio file upload and processing
- Instant transcription results display

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- Python 3.x
- FastAPI
- OpenAI Whisper
- uvicorn (ASGI server)
- SQLite database

### Frontend
- Next.js 15.1.0
- React 19
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Radix UI components
- Various React hooks and utilities

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the client directory:
```bash
cd client
```

2. Install dependencies using pnpm:
```bash
pnpm install
```

## Running the Application

### Start the Backend Server

1. From the backend directory:
```bash
python main.py
```
The backend server will start at `http://localhost:8000`

### Start the Frontend Development Server

1. From the client directory:
```bash
pnpm dev
```
The frontend development server will start at `http://localhost:3000`
